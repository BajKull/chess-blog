# Tata Steel Chess 2021: Giri Maintains Sole Lead

GM Anish Giri is still the sole leader at the Tata Steel Chess Tournament with two rounds to go. The Dutchman held GM Magnus Carlsen to a draw in round 11 and saw GM Alireza Firouzja and GM Fabiano Caruana draw a tense battle.

Failing to beat Giri, Carlsen is now almost out of contention for first place, two rounds before the end. After his disappointing first half, he couldn't make the comeback he was hoping for. Even if he wins his last two games, he'll end on 8/13, the same score that was good for only second place last year and most probably this year as well.

The other Norwegian did have reasons to smile today. GM Aryan Tari won his first game in the tournament, and it was a good one. GM Jorden van Foreest was the other winner after responding well to GM Pentala Harikrishna's sacrificial play in the opening.

Carlsen is always the biggest hurdle in a tournament, and perhaps especially so for Giri. The Dutchman finished in second place twice in Wijk aan Zee (in 2018 after losing the playoff, and 2019) and guess who won those tournaments. There's also a long history of mutual Twitter teasing between the two, but this year things have been remarkably quiet there.

Whether he stays away from daily tweets on purpose, it seems to work for Giri. He scored a solid draw today and had no reason not to be satisfied.

"If a draw with black against Magnus is not a good result, your life is in danger; something is really going wrong!" is how he put it.

In the final phase of the game, Giri was very comfortable, but he was under a bit of pressure before that. His light-squared bishop was out of play, almost as bad as William Winter's dark-squared bishop in what became a textbook win for Jose Capablanca in 1918.

"It was a bit suspect what I did," said Giri about his bishop being sidelined on the kingside. "It is well known that it's dubious to play this way, but on the other hand I got the rest of the position sort of fixed nicely."
